// make a website on someone who's influenced you using tailwind

// peer reviewer: Caleb Sylvia

// peer review comments: Site looks really good, the colors go very well together and match the overall theme. The font is also very nice makes sense with the character. For desktop I think it would be a nice touch for the friends section to have all the heights to match on the tab list of friends. On mobile I suggest adding a little bit of space on the bottom of the accordions but overall the site is so nice and W Mob such a great character.

// 1/24/24: fixed heights on tab list for friends and did it for all pages also. added padding on desktop and mobile under tabs and accordions. fixed background pics on life, friends and influence page
